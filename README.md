# CharFinder
Tensor flow test.
This program create an array of 8 random bit, this byte is a character. then it's sent to tensor flow.
Tensor flow is training to understand which byte is which char.
It's printing at each training step the Awaited array and the resulted array.
And the Accuracy when all the training is done

##  Requirement

  * Change nb_answers for number of answers created at each session
  * Change nb_test for the number of session
  * Change grad_value for the Gradient Descent Value
